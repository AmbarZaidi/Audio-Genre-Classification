# Audio Genre Classification

Supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms are applied to classify music tracks into their respective genres.

## Dataset:

	 GTZAN Music Genre Dataset, of 1000 audio tracks each 30 seconds long. There are 10 genres represented, each containing 100 tracks. All the tracks are 22050 Hz Mono 16-bit audio files in .au format.
	
## Techniques

- Kullback-Liebler (KL) Divergence
- K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- K-means clustering
- Multi-Class Support Vector Machine
- Convolutional Neural Networks
